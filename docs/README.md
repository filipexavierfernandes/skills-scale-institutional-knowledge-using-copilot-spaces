# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome! This README centralizes and summarizes how OctoAcme manages projects. It provides easy access to all major process documents and quick orientation for newcomers.

## Project Management Processes — Summary

OctoAcme follows a structured, customer-focused approach to project management:

### Core Principles
- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback and learning

### Project Lifecycle
1. **Initiation**: Problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Scope, resources, milestones, dependencies
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, iterate
4. **Release**: Deploy, verify, announce
5. **Close & Retrospective**: Capture learnings and next steps

### Key Roles
- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates agile ceremonies, removes impediments, and coaches on agile practices
- **UX Designer**: Conducts user research, creates designs, and validates usability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **External Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, approvals, and ensure organizational alignment

### Key Artifacts
- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items

### Communication Cadence
- Weekly sync between PM + PdM
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery team (or as agreed)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed
