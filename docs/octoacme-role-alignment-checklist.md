# OctoAcme — Role Alignment Checklist

## Purpose
Ensure all team members and stakeholders understand their roles, responsibilities, and how they interact with others throughout the project lifecycle. This checklist reduces confusion, prevents gaps in accountability, and minimizes single-person dependency risk.

## When to Use
- At project kickoff
- When new team members join
- After role changes or reorganizations
- During retrospectives if role confusion emerges

## Role Clarity Checklist

- [ ] Documentation sufficient for backup to take over
- [ ] Vacation/OOO coverage process defined
- [ ] Single points of failure identified and mitigated
- [ ] Knowledge transfer checklist created

## Verification Questions

Before project kickoff, confirm:
1. Can each team member name who they work with most closely?
2. Does everyone know who makes final decisions on scope, design, and technical choices?
3. Are handoff points between roles clearly defined?
4. Can team members describe what happens if they're blocked or unavailable?
5. Is there documentation sufficient for a new team member to understand each role?

## Red Flags (Address Immediately)
- ❌ Team member unsure of their responsibilities
- ❌ Overlapping accountability without clear primary owner
- ❌ No backup identified for critical roles
- ❌ Unclear escalation path for blockers
- ❌ Missing participants in key ceremonies
- ❌ Stakeholder approval process undefined
- ❌ Communication gaps between roles
- ❌ No documentation of role responsibilities

## Continuous Improvement
- Review this checklist during project retrospectives
- Update role definitions as processes evolve
- Capture lessons learned about role clarity
- Share successful patterns across teams
- Update onboarding materials with role clarifications
